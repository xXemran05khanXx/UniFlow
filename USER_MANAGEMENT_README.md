## Data Structure

### User Schema
```javascript
{
  name: String,              // Full name
  email: String,             // Unique email address
  password: String,          // Hashed password
  role: Enum,               // 'admin', 'teacher', 'student'
  isActive: Boolean,        // Account status
  isEmailVerified: Boolean, // Email verification status
  profile: {
    firstName: String,
    lastName: String,
    phone: String,
    bio: String,
    location: String,
    website: String
  },
  preferences: {
    theme: String,
    notifications: Object,
    language: String
  },
  lastLogin: Date,
  loginAttempts: Number,
  lockUntil: Date,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Password Management
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds
- Temporary passwords generated for admin resets
- Minimum password requirements enforced

### Account Security
- Automatic account locking after failed login attempts
- Manual unlock capability for administrators
- Audit trail for sensitive operations

### Data Protection
- Sensitive information excluded from API responses
- Role-based access control enforced
- Input validation and sanitization
